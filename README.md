This is an Airport Managemnet Project written in c++ using the concept of OOP.
I have designed the UI in console. So, for better user experience run the project in CodeBlocks.

The project includes the managemnet of visitors and flights. 
It also contains an admin setup (USERNAME= admin, PASS= 123). Admin can check the visitors complaints and hotel details.
There are many more features in this project like updating and deleting flights schedule by admin. 

Everything is coded with the basic concept of OOP.
